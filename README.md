# Supermarket
Simulations of interaction in a supermarket

  For testing you have to introduce username: gabimocanu and the password is 1234, not a strong one, huh ?
  The program starts in AppStart.java where you have to choose three options:
  1. Client
  2. Administrator
  3. Upload( Until you don't upload data you can't access any mode
  
  If you choose Administrator mode then you have to introduce credentials from above. These are keept in administratori.txt. 
Then you can modify any department you want and for every department you can add products, remove products, modify products and 
you can see statistics about that department. Of course you can order alphabetically or by price any list of products.
  
  If you choose Client mode then you have to select one client from that list. For every client we have a list of notifications 
and options for wishlist and shopping cart. You can add or remove products and we have two new options: "Take Product" that 
remove a product from wishlist according to the strategy that client have and add this product to the shopping cart and "Send 
Order" that simulates and execution of the order.
